 <h2>Black rose </h2> 
<p>Black rose you are 
so misunderstood.
People sneer at you
take no notice.
Cause you are blessed
black rose you are unique,
Don’t let them take away
you diamond heart.
Being a black rose 
it hurt sometime
don’t get weary.
Because your time will come
don’t turn your heart
Don’t walk away from a path 
you got to make it your own.
Be a star that shines in the twilight
black rose you are. 
A rough cut diamond 
don’t believe that you are not
Good enough
don’t allow you the spark in your eye to dim out
 Being a black rose 
it hurt sometime.
Don’t get weary
because your time will come.
Being a black rose is a blessing
walking through the fire 
It will mold you and make you shine like gold
the pressure around you will into a beautiful pearl
 Being a black rose 
it hurt sometime
Don’t get weary
because your time will come
Listen to me
heed my words
I’m a black rose 
dare to be you
And be the black rose you are!</p>
