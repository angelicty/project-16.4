        <p> <em> <strong>Poetry is a form of expression thatuses words to tell a story. We are all a collection of stories. This is site is dedicated to an inspiring poet that comes from the Heart of Africa and has been writing since she was a child. Tega-yombi Mutimura has been inspired by artist like poet Shakespeare and Keats. That she has decided to showcase her work.
        I am aa university graduate that is passionated about writing and telling stories. I believe that words have the power to build or teardown the world. So I am here to express myself to the world and invite you to learn to heal through words. Paper is like a canvas and my pen is like a paintbrush writing worlds for the world to see. Everyone has something to say and feelings to express my way of expressing is painting words with my pen.</strong></em><p>
